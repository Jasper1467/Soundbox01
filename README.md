# WHAT IS THIS?
Soundbox01 is a small project to read a `.wav` file into a memory mapped area and then played through your speakers using XAUDIO2 Sound API from Microsoft.

# HOW TO I USE IT
Download the project, and have Visual Studio 2022 ready, if you have the developer tools installed you can open a Command Prompt and to build the project use MSBUILD Soundbox01.sln

# GOOD TO KNOW INFORMATION 
This is still in its early conception and as such there might be subtle bugs and other stuff that can ruin your user-experience.
It works on my machine, but that is no guarantee that it will work on yours, but I cannot see why it should not work for you.


I will try and update with more information and as such, if you have any feedback or suggestions create a pull request and I will be happy to discuss it further.
